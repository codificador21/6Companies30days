We will maintain a minheap of size 10.
Insert first 10 values.
From the 10 numbers we will compare each number with the root node of min heap(ie the min value).
If the number is greater than the root node's value, we will pop the root node and insert the new number.
If the number is smaller than the root node's value, we will simply continue to the next number.
After traversing all the numbers, the minheap will contain the largest 10 numbers.
